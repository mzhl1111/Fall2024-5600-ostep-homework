result compare:
- process 1: turnaround 21 vs 24 , response same
- process 2: all the same
- process 3: turnaround 24 vs 19, response same
- process 4: all the same

key difference, when a new process comes, one put into the first position of a queue, one put into the last position that follows FIFO, thus little bit difference on the response time, resulting to turnaround time.
